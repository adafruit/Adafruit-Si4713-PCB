Become your very own pirate radio station with this FM radio transmitter. This breakout board, based on the best-of-class Si4713, is an all-in-one stereo audio FM transmitter that can also transmit RDS/RBDS data!

Wire up to your favorite microcontroller (we suggest an Arduino) to the I2C data lines to set the transmit frequency and play line-level audio into the stereo headphone jack. Boom! Now you are the media. Listen using any FM receiver such as your car or pocket radio receiver - this is an easy way to transmit audio up to about 10 meters / 30 feet away.
